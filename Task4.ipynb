        "   - Finally, I applied an `RZ` gate to qubit 4 to rotate it around the Z-axis by π/4. This is used to fine-tune the phase of the qubit.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Transpile the Circuit**: To optimize the circuit for a specific backend (the `statevector_simulator`), I used the `transpile` function with a set of basis gates (`x`, `h`, `rz`, `cx`) and optimization level 3. Transpiling helps adapt the circuit to the quantum hardware or simulator, making it more efficient.\n",
        "\n",
